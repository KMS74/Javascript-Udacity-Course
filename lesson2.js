/*
 - In the case of "regular comparison", the operands on either side of the == operator are first 
 converted to numbers, before comparison. Therefore, a ' ', false, and 0 are all considered equal.
  Similarly, a '1' and 1 are also considered equal.
   If we don't want to convert the operands, before comparison, 
   we have to use a "strict comparison" ===, that is explained below.

 - A strongly typed language is a programming language that is more likely to generate errors 
  if data does not closely match an expected type. Because JavaScript is loosely typed, you donâ€™t need to specify data types; 
  however, this can lead to errors that are hard to diagnose due to implicit type coercion.
